# This project is about creating a simple calculator 

# need to ask user to enter two numbers

# add numbers
# subtract numbers
# divide numbers 
# multiple numbers 

# Need to take user input 
# when user is done with operation, ask user again if want to continue calculating 
# what if user enters negative numbers? what to do then?
# what if user enters wrong input 
# user might enter decimal values 
# with dividing numbers can throw an error of zero division
# have to provide user with choices as to what operation needs to carried out 
# user might enter a string value instead of integers or floats 


# first lets print out our choices to ask user 

print("Select choice:")
print("1. Add:" + "+")
print("2. Subtract:" + "-")
print("3. Multiply:" + "*")
print("4. Divide:" + "/")


# lets ask the user to enter choice
